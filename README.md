# Automating the Comparison of Areas and Data of Administrative Units From Different Periods

## Requirements
The packages required for the project to work can be found in the requirements.txt file

## Usage
- We specify the path to the input files where the administrative units information is stored (preferably .shp)
- We choose one of four types of comparison
- We choose in what percentage they must intersect to be taken into account in the comparison
- We choose the name and path of the output file and the format of the result between (.shp and .txt)

## Test data
The test data is located in a folder named input. The column names responsible for the population numbers are 'lud' and 'o_lud'
